## Logging

The latest logs are written to `pulsepilot_log.txt` once the bot exits. Each time the bot is run, the current 
`pulsepilot_log.txt` file is overwritten with the most recent logs. The logs record both info messages and any error messages.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Saving Data

Data is saved to `pulsepilot_data.txt` once the bot exits. Each time the bot exits, the current 
`pulsepilot_data.txt` file is overwritten with the most recent data.

**Warning:** Should this file be corrupted,there is a slim chance of recovery.
**Tip:** Ensure that you always have a _backup copy stored safely_ to prevent permanent data loss.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## FAQ

**1.** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

Ensure that the `pulsepilot.jar` is placed in the **same folder** as `pulsepilot_data.txt`. PulsePilot should recognise
and synchronise your data contents from `pulsepilot_data.txt` if done correctly.

**Tip:** Create a _backup copy_ to prior to file transfer to avoid data corruption.

**2.** What happens if my data is corrupted?

Depending on the severity of corruption, you may experience 2 scenarios:

- A full corruption

____________________________________________________________
```

In either case, you may want to overwrite/replace the current `pulsepilot_data.txt` with that of your backup in order to restore your data.


A full corruption indicates permanent and complete data loss. Please delete `pulsepilot_data.txt` and relaunch PulsePilot.

A partial corruption indicates a partial recovery of data up until the point of corruption. We recommend utilising the `history` command to review and discrepancies
and missing data. You may choose to re-enter the corrupted data to be saved again upon `exit`.
